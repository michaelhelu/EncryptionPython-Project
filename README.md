# 🔐 Caesar Cipher Encryption Project

This project is a simple implementation of symmetric encryption and decryption using the **Caesar Cipher** algorithm in Python.

## 📂 Files Included

- `EncryptionProject.py` – Python script for encrypting and decrypting text files using Caesar Cipher.
- `input.txt` – Sample plain text input to be encrypted.
- `encrypted_file.txt` – Output of the encryption process (Caesar-encrypted text).
- `decrypted_file.txt` – Output file generated after decrypting `encrypted_file.txt`.
  
## 🧠 How It Works

The Caesar Cipher is a basic substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places down or up the alphabet.

- **Encryption**: shifts each letter forward by a given key.
- **Decryption**: shifts each letter backward using the same key.

Non-letter characters (punctuation, numbers, etc.) are left unchanged.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Place your input text in `input.txt`.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python EncryptionProject.py
